# JRepo

**A simple, cross-platform file sync tool for a lone developer or a small team.**

**JRepo** is my personal "repo" solution for my source code and projects. I use this personally and at work as a cheap/easy trick to 'push' up code, then 'pull' it down on the server to run. It's because I am laxy and didn't want to remember `Robocopy` or `rsync` commands and fix line endings.

---

## What is JRepo?

JRepo pushes and pulls project directories to and from network shares — no git server, no config files, no dependencies beyond what's already on your OS.

Point it at a UNC path (Windows) or mount point (Linux), and it mirrors your current directory there. That's it.

Built for the part time dev who:

- Deploy code to servers via NAS / SMB shares
- Sync projects between machines without setting up git remotes
- Need a quick "push up, pull down" workflow for Docker hosts
- Want something simpler than rsync flags and robocopy switches to remember

---

## Features

- **Cross-platform** — Windows (Robocopy) and Linux (rsync), same workflow on both
- **Push** from any directory to a network share or mount point
- **Pull** from a network share or mount point into any directory
- **Folder name mismatch detection** — warns you if local and remote folder names don't match
- **Automatic CRLF → LF fix** on Linux pull (safe — only touches text files)
- **`.jrepoignore`** for excluding files and directories (like `.gitignore`)
- **`jrepo init`** to create a default `.jrepoignore` with defaults

---

## Installation

### Windows

Run `install.bat` **as Administrator** (right-click → Run as administrator):

```
install.bat
```

This will:

- Copy all scripts to `C:\Tools\JRepo\`
- Add `C:\Tools\JRepo\` to your system PATH
- Open a **new terminal** afterward for PATH changes to take effect

### Linux

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

This will:

- Copy scripts to `/usr/local/bin/` (with `.sh` extension removed)
- Copy docs to `/usr/local/share/jrepo/`
- Verify all commands are in PATH

### Manual Installation

Just copy the scripts to any directory in your PATH:

- **Windows:** Copy all `.cmd` and `.ps1` files to a folder, then add that folder to your PATH.
- **Linux:** Copy the `.sh` files, drop the extension, and `chmod +x`:

## Quick Start

Develop on Windows:

```cmd
cd C:\Projects\myapp
jrepo init
notepad .jrepoignore
jrepo push \\nas01\repos\myapp --dry-run
jrepo push \\nas01\repos\myapp
```

Pull Down on Linux Host:

```
mkdir /opt/myapp
cd /opt/myapp
jrepo init
jrepo pull /mnt/nas/repos/myapp

# Setup variables and start application
cp example.env .env
nano .env
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Usage

### `jrepo push`

Mirrors the current directory **to** a remote path.

```
jrepo push <PATH> [--all] [--force] [--dry-run]
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--all` | Push all files, ignoring `.jrepoignore` exclusions |
| `--force` | Wipe the destination first, then push a clean copy (prompts for confirmation) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview only — no files are copied or deleted |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard deploy push (respects .jrepoignore)
jrepo push /mnt/nas/repos/myapp

# Push everything for safekeeping
jrepo push /mnt/nas/repos/myapp --all

# Nuke remote and push fresh
jrepo push /mnt/nas/repos/myapp --force

# Preview a force push
jrepo push /mnt/nas/repos/myapp --force --dry-run
```

---

### `jrepo pull`

Mirrors a remote path **into** the current directory.

```
jrepo pull <PATH> [--all] [--force] [--dry-run] [--no-eol]
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--all` | Pull all files, ignoring `.jrepoignore` exclusions |
| `--force` | Wipe the local directory first, then pull a clean copy (prompts for confirmation) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview only — no files are copied or deleted |
| `--no-eol` | Skip the automatic CRLF → LF line-ending fix (Linux only) |

> **Note:** The `--no-eol` flag is only available in the Linux (bash) version of `jrepo pull`. The Windows version does not perform line-ending conversion.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard deploy pull (respects .jrepoignore, fixes line endings)
jrepo pull /mnt/nas/repos/myapp

# Pull everything to work on it
jrepo pull /mnt/nas/repos/myapp --all

# Nuke local and pull fresh
jrepo pull /mnt/nas/repos/myapp --force

# Pull without fixing line endings
jrepo pull /mnt/nas/repos/myapp --no-eol
```

---

### `jrepo init`

Creates a default `.jrepoignore` file in the current directory.

```
jrepo init
```

If a `.jrepoignore` already exists, it will prompt before overwriting.

The generated file includes sensible defaults for Python, Node, environment files, logs, temp files, OS junk, version control directories, and common build directories.

---

## `.jrepoignore` Pattern Guide

Place a `.jrepoignore` file in your project root. The syntax is simple:

| Pattern | Type | Example | What it excludes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/dirname` | Directory (leading `/`) | `/data` | The `data/` directory |
| `dirname/` | Directory (trailing `/`) | `logs/` | The `logs/` directory |
| `*.ext` | Extension / wildcard | `*.pyc` | All `.pyc` files |
| `name.ext` | Specific file (has a `.`) | `config.local` | That exact file |
| `name` | Ambiguous (no `.` or `/`) | `__pycache__` | Excluded as **both** a directory and a file |
| `# comment` | Comment | `# ignore logs` | Ignored |
| *(blank line)* | —   |     | Ignored |

**Example `.jrepoignore`:**

```gitignore
# Python
*.pyc
__pycache__

# Environment / secrets
*.env
.env

# Directories
/data
/.git
/node_modules

# OS junk
Thumbs.db
.DS_Store

# Temp files
*.tmp
*~
```

> **Important:** If `--all` is not used and no `.jrepoignore` file is found, the script will exit with an error. This prevents accidentally syncing everything (including secrets, data directories, etc.). Use `jrepo init` to create one, or pass `--all` if you intentionally want to sync everything.
